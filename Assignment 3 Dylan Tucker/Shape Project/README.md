-----ASSIGNMENT 3--------

LEVEL 1:

- Made shapes for square, rectangle, and circle
- all have area methods, list attribute methods, and drawing logic
- Learning to do the drawing was a rough patch
- Abstract shape class
- shared attributes inclue name, color, and the change color method
- abstract methods are getarea, list attributes and draw
- implemented square, rectangle, and circle

-For interfaces part,
- did the same stuff, a lot of it looked oddly similar

LEVEL 2:

- Already did three shapes
- Polymorphism used in the form of the changecolor function in the abstract class and how the functions were overriden rather than all unique names. Also, in the interface section I used a "BASE SHAPE" class to set up shared attributes while not being abstract. 

LEVEL 3:

- Code in different packages:
- Abstract, ConcreteA, and ExceptionHandlers for Abstract part
- ConcreteB, Interface, and ExceptionHandlers for Interface part
- JavaDoc used
